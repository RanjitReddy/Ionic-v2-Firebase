# Ionic 2 Demo with Firebase Auth and Database Usage

This is a sample of Ionic v2 and Firebase Auth and DB Connection. 
You can signup and login to the system then you can add your notes like to-do app.

Firebase Auth System is used for Signup and Login.
Firebase DB is used for adding notes.

I have used [Ionic v2 Conferance App](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-conference-app) for template.

Other than Firebase, I have used Google Maps API for a simple Google Maps Demo from Conferance App.

## Getting Started

Firstly, update myFirebaseConfig in app.module.ts for your own settings.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mg52/Ionic-v2-Firebase
$ cd Ionic-v2-Firebase
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
